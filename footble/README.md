# Footble

This is a wordle style website where players must guess the Champions League team.

This website initially began as a Figma design which can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/eyNV3DrwO4WFlMcNg4R86b/Footble?m=auto&t=7YX6HG5woLGdp9KS-6).

This website is powered by React and Vite, alongside the following packages:

- [Geolib](https://github.com/manuelbieh/geolib) - Provides the distance and direction between two sets of coordinates.
- [MUI X Charts](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/) - Allows for the implementation of a dynamic chart to display data.
- [React Select](https://react-select.com/) - Provides a configurable input field and dropdown list combination.
